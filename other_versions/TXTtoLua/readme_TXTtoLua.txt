This repository contains Lua scripts to build a Lua table from a text file with tabulators

The tabulators must be regular, i.e. the number of tabulators in a line must be equal or one more than in the line before.

All the scripts have at the end a return command. It may be necessary to omit it.

As an example the scripts them selfs are treated by the scripts. The result is a description of the code in a tree.

1. TXTtoLua_Linux.lua

Script for Linux system.

2. TXTtoLua_Windows.lua

Script forWindows system.
