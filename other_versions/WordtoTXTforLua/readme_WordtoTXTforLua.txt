This repository has a Lua script to convert a word file to text (TXT) with Luacom

The conversion is done only if the corresponding text (TXT) does not exist or if the date of the securisation is older than the date of the word file.

1. WordtoTXTforLua_Windows.lua

This script is only for Windows because there the luacom-Library of the IUP-Lua framework is available.
